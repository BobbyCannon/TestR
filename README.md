#### TestR

Integration testing framework for developers. TestR allows automating testing of web and desktop applications. Currently we are supporting Chrome, Edge (chromium based) and Firefox*.

If you need InternetExplorer support then use TestR v2.1.1.

Minimal requirement for setup. Simply reference the TestR nuget then make some minor configuration for some browsers (firefox).
